Fluent in French and English, currently based in North Hatley, Canada

## Experience

I'm a full-stack developer, proficient with the full spectrum of the development process, starting with user experience research and design, to front-end development with both React and Svelte, to back-end development in either Node.js or Python, passing by mobile development with React Native or Flutter, and finally managing both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. Most of my work is in the ecommerce domain, where I've gained extensive experience with Shopify and Stripe/Braintree custom integrations. These days as Lead Developper, I've added project management and business intelligence skills to my toolbelt.

And yet today, there's still plenty more for me to learn :)

### Lead Developer, Dispatch Coffee

_May 2019 - Present_

I started working for Dispatch Coffee as a freelancer to rebuild their [e-commerce subscription platform](https://dispatchcoffee.ca) and have since moved to a full-time Lead Developer position. My role at Dispatch involves new feature development, user interface research and design, answering business intelligence queries, project management, and writing technical documentation. I've been with Dispatch from their launch online to a now approaching ~2500 active subscribers.


### Full-stack Web Developer, Freelance

_2012 - Present_

To be a freelancer had always been a dream of mine. I'm able to give plenty of myself to my fellow aspiring business owners. Whether they're artists, designers, developers, or entrepreneurs, I'm grateful for the opportunity to offer them what they need on the Web.

I worked as a front-end developer for the menswear e-commerce store [Frank and Oak](https://www.frankandoak.com/), I was solely responsible for the mobile version of site and I've laid the foundation for the current Backbone.js based version of the site. Working for F&O opened many doors for me and I'm grateful for the relationships I built there.


### Interactive Learning Developer, Nav Canada
