Fluent in French and English, currently based in Montréal, Canada

## Experience

I'm a full-stack developer, proficient with the full spectrum of the development process, starting with user experience research and design, to front-end development with both HTML/Sass and React with styled-components, to back-end development in either Node.js or Python, passing by mobile development with React Native or Flutter, and finally managing both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. Most of my work is in the ecommerce domain, where I've gained extensive experience with Shopify and Stripe/Braintree custom integrations.

And yet today, there's still plenty more for me to learn :)

### Full-stack Web Developer, Freelance

### Mobile Web Developer, Frank and Oak

_August 2013 - May 2014_

I worked as a front-end developer for the menswear e-commerce store [Frank and Oak](https://www.frankandoak.com/), I was solely responsible for the mobile version of site and I've laid the foundation for the current Backbone.js based version of the site. Working for F&O opened many doors for me and I'm grateful for the relationships I built there.


### Interactive Learning Developer, Nav Canada

_May 2009 - August 2012 as intermittent Co-op placements, Full-time from January 2013 to August 2013_

I worked multiple co-op placements with the Interactive Learning Products team at NAV CANADA, where I built a variety of training modules for air traffic controllers using Adobe Flash and Actionscript 3.0. Also built prototypes of new systems and technologies for iOS with the iPad, as well as web applications with the Drupal CMS. This experience greatly improved my organizational and communication skills in an environment where teamwork was forefront.
